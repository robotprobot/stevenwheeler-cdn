## How to report a vulnerability with the CDN
The CDN itself is publically accessible, thus does not have any security concerns directly.

However, if you have found a vulnerability relating to something hosted on the CDN, 
please open a issue request in the repo for that item if possible. 
Otherwise, open an issue in this repo.
